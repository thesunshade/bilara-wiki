The Bilara webapp offers the ability to publish texts directly from the webapp. Here's how it works.

1. When a translator is ready, they can hit <kbd>Publish</kbd> on Bilara.
    - **Check and double check your work before publishing! We strongly encourage one or two rounds of proofreading by a third party. SC is not a blog or social media: translators are creating sacred texts to last the test of time. Take the time to do it well. [Remember the chariot-maker!](https://suttacentral.net/an3.15/en/sujato)**
2. Bilara lets you publish at any level of granularity: a sutta, a vagga, a whole nikaya. If you publish a nikaya, you don't have to publish each sutta individually. 
    - These options are there to accommodate the different working preferences of translators. If you prefer to publish one sutta at a time, you can. Or if you prefer to complete and revise a whole nikaya before publishing all at once, you can.
3. Confirm the publication when the dialog pops up.
    - The dialog gives you a link so you can check the success of your publication on Github.
4. There is now a "Pull Request" open for your chosen text on Github. This is awaiting review by an Admin member of the SuttaCentral team. They will review your request before accepting it to the "Published" branch. If there is any problem they will contact you. 
    - Note that this Pull Request is not intended for proof reading or otherwise checking the text in detail. It is to ensure that the pull is technically valid and that the material seems reasonable.
5. A SuttaCentral Admin accepts the PR. Your text is now in the [Published branch of Bilara-data](https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data/tree/published).
    - This is the canonical home of your text. 
6. Texts in the Published branch will automatically become available for publishing by any app that consumes bilara-data.
    - This includes the SuttaCentral website and SC-Voice. It may also include other apps that third-parties build relying on our data.
7. Yikes, I made a mistake! Never mind, to correct or update you text, just make the changes as usual in Bilara, then press "Update".
